A simple bank project

This bank project demonstrates some DOM manipulation and simple to advance array methods displaying and mutating the data within the accounts of the project. This project also makes use of setTimeout to allow a slight delay when adding new data to be displayed in an account and setInterval to only allow a login of an account to have a set amount of time before being logged out and having to log in again.

This project has allowed me to make use of beginner to intermediate use of array methods in Javascript and also allowed to better understand DOM manipulation when it comes to projects like this.

To log in you would need to get the initials of the owner in an account.

Example: Account1 object contains an Owner of "Eric Peter Manalili"
Initials are "epm"

user: epm
pin: 1111

Pin is hardcoded in an account object.
